reddit-web-crawler
==================

The first task of the [Mining Facebook](http://www.inf.tu-dresden.de/index.php?node_id=3630&amp;ln=en) course is to develop a simple [reddit](reddit.com) web crawler, preferable in python.

## Update
Instead of Reddit Facebook data was used later on. The idea was to predict the number of like a post would get. Unfortunately our data basis was so bad that the result was totally useless. Course was fun thoughâ€¦
